# Output Match Testing Tool

Testing tool for checking programs console output.

## Overview

The tool allows you to check the program correctness. It will run
the SUT (System Under Test) program with specified input and match the standard
output and exit code to assumptions given in test file.

## Installing

### Zero Install

It is recommended to use [Zero Install - A decentralised cross-platform software
installation system](https://0install.net/). Zero Install will download the OMTT
in a secure way and will care about updates.

After installing Zero Install, type in the console:

```bash
0install add omtt https://apps.chyla.org/omtt.xml
```

May be needed to modify your `PATH` variable, Zero Install will notify you.

You may need to re-open the console.

### Binary packages

Binary packages can be downloaded from the [GitHub project releases
page](https://github.com/chyla/OutputMatchTestingTool/releases).

Download the binaries and place them in your `PATH`.

### Building the sources

To build application from the sources see the [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) file
for details.

## Getting Started

To run the tool you will need to compile it from the sources (see
the *Installing from the sources* section) or get the already
compiled binary. Then you will need to write the test and run
the tool with specified path to the SUT. The tool will run the SUT,
check the expectations and print the results.

The next steps of this introduction will use the Unix `cat` program.
Here is what the manual says about it: *concatenate files and print
on the standard output*. When the input file is not given the standard
input is printed on the standard output, we will use this.

### Full output match

Here is the first test file example for the `cat` program:

```text
RUN
WITH INPUT
Hello world!
EXPECT OUTPUT
Hello world!
EXPECT EXIT WITH SUCCESS
```

I hope the test file is self-documenting and everything is obvious. Save
the test to `cat-will_print_input_and_exit_with_success.omtt` file, then run
the tool like that to execute the test with the `cat` binary:

```text
omtt --sut /bin/cat cat-will_print_input_and_exit_with_success.omtt
```

The tool will print the summary containing the most basic information
and the test verdict:

```text
Testing: /bin/cat
====================
Running test (1/1): cat-will_print_input_and_exit_with_success.omtt
Verdict: PASS
====================
1 tests total, 1 passed, 0 failed
```

You will see more info when the test fail. See this test example
for the `cat` program:

```text
RUN
WITH INPUT
Some text.
EXPECT OUTPUT
Some other text.
EXPECT EXIT CODE 1
```

Here are the results:

```text
Testing: /bin/cat
====================
Running test (1/1): examples/cat-failing_scenario-will_exit_with_non_zero_exit_status_and_some_output_when_some_other_input_is_given.omtt
Verdict: FAIL
--------------------
=> Cause:
Exit code doesn't match.
Expected: 1
Got: 0
--------------------
=> Cause:
Output doesn't match.
First difference at byte: 5
Expected (context):
S    o    m    e    SPC  o    t    h    e    r    SPC  t
                         ^
0x53 0x6f 0x6d 0x65 0x20 0x6f 0x74 0x68 0x65 0x72 0x20 0x74
Got (context):
S    o    m    e    SPC  t    e    x    t    .
                         ^
0x53 0x6f 0x6d 0x65 0x20 0x74 0x65 0x78 0x74 0x2e
====================
1 tests total, 0 passed, 1 failed
```

### Partial output match

It's possible to search for only part of output, it won't give you detailed
description about the mismatch like in full output match. Here's example:

```text
RUN
WITH INPUT
Hello world.
EXPECT IN OUTPUT
Hello
EXPECT IN OUTPUT
WORLD
EXPECT EXIT CODE 0
```

The results:

```text
Testing: /bin/cat
====================
Running test (1/1): examples/cat-failing_scenario-mismatch_while_matching_part_of_output.omtt
Verdict: FAIL
--------------------
=> Cause:
Text not found in output.
Expected (context):
W    O    R    L    D
0x57 0x4f 0x52 0x4c 0x44
====================
1 tests total, 0 passed, 1 failed
```

### Comments

Comments begins with `/*` and ends with `*/`, are allowed only on top
of the test (see the `cat-will_print_input_and_exit_with_success.omtt` example):

```text
/*
 * This test will check cat prints given input and exits with zero.
 */

RUN
WITH INPUT
Hello world!
EXPECT OUTPUT
Hello world!
EXPECT EXIT CODE 0
```

### Messages from SUT standard error

Messages printed by SUT on standard error are shown after the test inside
the 'SUT error messages printed during test execution' section. The messages
do not affect the test result.

Here is the example result:

```text
Testing: systemtests/apps/scaterr
====================
Running test (1/1): systemtests/omtt/scaterr-error_text_on_input.omtt
Verdict: PASS
--------------------
=> SUT error messages printed during test execution:
example error message
====================
1 tests total, 1 passed, 0 failed
```

### Running multiple tests

Multiple tests can be executed by passing its paths in command line:

```text
omtt --sut /bin/cat examples/cat-will_match_part_of_output.omtt examples/cat-will_print_input_and_exit_with_success.omtt
```

Tests will be executed in order they appeared in command line:

```text
Testing: /bin/cat
====================
Running test (1/2): examples/cat-will_match_part_of_output.omtt
Verdict: PASS
====================
Running test (2/2): examples/cat-will_print_input_and_exit_with_success.omtt
Verdict: PASS
====================
2 tests total, 2 passed, 0 failed
```

With a little help of shell you can run tests by name pattern:

```text
omtt --sut /bin/cat examples/cat-will*.omtt
```

Results:

```text
Testing: /bin/cat
====================
Running test (1/4): examples/cat-will-exit-with-zero.omtt
Verdict: PASS
====================
Running test (2/4): examples/cat-will_match_part_of_output.omtt
Verdict: PASS
====================
Running test (3/4): examples/cat-will-output-user-given-input.omtt
Verdict: PASS
====================
Running test (4/4): examples/cat-will_print_input_and_exit_with_success.omtt
Verdict: PASS
====================
4 tests total, 4 passed, 0 failed
```

### Line endings

Any `CR` and `CR` `LF` pair in test file or SUT output will be replaced to `LF`.

### Examples

See more tests examples in the `examples` directory.
